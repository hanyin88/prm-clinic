28,"[doctor] next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9/23/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8/3/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease .
[doctor] ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .
[patient] yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .
[doctor] i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] pretty good . i'm definitely feeling better , thank goodness . i was having a rough time before surgery , um , but i think i'm overall pretty good now though .
[doctor] okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?
[patient] no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .
[doctor] okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?
[patient] uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .
[doctor] what is a while ?
[patient] it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .
[doctor] okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?
[patient] yeah , just often enough for me to notice .
[doctor] understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?
[patient] uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .
[doctor] okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?
[patient] yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .
[doctor] are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?
[patient] not really . uh , i notice that the atenolol is making me irritable in the beginning , but i guess i've gotten used to it , does n't seem to bother me as much now .
[doctor] okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
[patient] that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
[doctor] yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .
[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .
[doctor] okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] how about there ? and your feet ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .
[patient] good .
[doctor] yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
[patient] yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
[doctor] great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .
[patient] great .
[doctor] so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .
[patient] i'll do my best .
[doctor] and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , i do . when do i need to come back and get checked out ?
[doctor] well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months .
[patient] all right , thank you . it was good to see you again dr. hughes .

29,"[doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8/10/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri .
[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

30,"[doctor] okay hi wayne well i understand you're here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right
[patient] yes
[doctor] so can you tell me about that how are you doing
[patient] well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one
[doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound
[patient] about two to three weeks
[doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot
[patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and
[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot
[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though
[doctor] okay now does it hurt
[patient] no i ca n't feel it
[doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines
[patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on
[doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem
[patient] no i'm upset
[doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes
[patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes
[doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they
[patient] they're hoka's
[doctor] ah so where did you get them
[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago
[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so what do you like about them
[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability
[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing
[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight
[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no it's okay
[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright do you have any other questions
[patient] no

31,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .
[doctor] physical exam findings of breast , inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally . there is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally . no breast tenderness , masses , or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable .","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

32,"[doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12/8/1920 . the date of service is 7/9/2021 . this is a new patient note .
[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .
[doctor] for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today .
[doctor] her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only .
[doctor] her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated .
[doctor] and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Heart Murmur
Assessment: The patient has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids, most likely representing aortic stenosis. However, her S2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with moderate aortic stenosis. She may have had an echocardiogram in the past.
Plan:
- Will obtain an echocardiogram today to further evaluate the severity of her aortic stenosis.
- If the echocardiogram confirms severe aortic stenosis, will consider TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) or SAVR (surgical aortic valve replacement).
2. PVCs
Assessment: The patient has frequent PVCs on EKG, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations.
Plan:
- Will monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm.
- If the patient develops significant palpitations or arrhythmias, will consider starting antiarrhythmic therapy.
3. Hyperthyroidism
Assessment: The patient is taking levothyroxine for hyperthyroidism.
Plan:
- Continue levothyroxine as prescribed by her primary care provider.
4. Leg Pain
Assessment: The patient has severe leg pain in both legs, which may be related to her aortic stenosis.
Plan:
- Will discuss with the patient's primary care provider whether she needs to continue taking simvastatin for her lipid levels.
5. Hypertension
Assessment: The patient's blood pressure is well controlled.
Plan:
- Continue amlodipine and lisinopril as prescribed.
Follow-up instructions:
- Return to clinic in 3-4 weeks to discuss the results of the echocardiogram and next steps.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

33,"[doctor] so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on
[patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot
[doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before
[patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day
[doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing
[patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help
[doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing
[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity
[doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt
[patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes
[doctor] okay how about when you stand back up
[patient] no pain
[doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury
[patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't
[doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back
[patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him
[doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands
[patient] can you repeat that
[doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back
[patient] i
[doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg
[patient] that would be my right leg
[doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
[patient] i have not taken meloxicam
[doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
[patient] it sounds reasonable
[doctor] alright
[patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it
[doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving

34,"[doctor] so jerry is a 45 -year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury jerry what happened
[patient] hey doctor michael yeah so my son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen
[doctor] yeah
[patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so
[doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way
[patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys
[doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad
[patient] yeah yes
[doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all
[patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid
[doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches
[patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach
[doctor] great
[patient] starting in april so
[doctor] alright well
[patient] how long
[doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly
[patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out
[doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do

36,"[doctor] so tyler is a 56 -year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem
[patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking
[doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing
[patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down
[doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that
[patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids
[doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that
[patient] it's really just about solids
[doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all
[patient] not that i want
[doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going
[patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise
[doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all
[patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time
[doctor] and how are the numbers looking
[patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting
[doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home
[patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range
[doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that
[patient] no that sounds great
[doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that

[patient] it's been a week , doctor . yeah .

[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , did you take any medication yourself ?
[patient] no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] . i was actually in gymnastics class .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .
[doctor] okay , uh-
[patient] i went overboard , i think . yeah .
[doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
[patient] uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
[doctor] does that- does it hurt ?

[patient] any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .
[doctor] okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh-
[patient] uh- .
[doctor] . a little bit .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
[patient] and for how long ? yes .
[doctor] for a week .
[patient] a week , okay .
[doctor] and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-

[doctor] um ...
[patient] but i wanted you to know that i did have past surgery on my , um , left arm-

[patient] okay .
[doctor] . while it's healing .

[patient] can i , uh , carry any heavy weights or-
[doctor] no , no . definitely not .
[patient] . anything like that ?
[doctor] definitely not .
[patient] okay . okay .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] . instead-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . for the next , uh , at least just three to four weeks .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] uh , come back to see me if the pain , you know , still there after maybe three weeks-
[patient] sure .
[doctor] . so we can take a further look .
[patient] okay . sure .

[patient] yeah .
[doctor] . after just resting and regular pain reliever .
[patient] okay . all right .
[doctor] um-

38,"[patient] hi kenneth how are you the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain yeah i was getting ready for the holiday weekend and i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since
[doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then
[patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend
[doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it
[patient] it's my right knee
[doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened
[patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards
[doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance
[patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore
[doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before
[patient] no that was the first time
[doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake
[patient] lake martin
[doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier
[patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can
[doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day
[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway
[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked
[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
[patient] i had my tonsils out
[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions

39,"[patient] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
[doctor] how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Trigeminal Neuralgia 
Assessment: Patient presents with right-sided facial pain, which is consistent with the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. The MRI showed compression of the blood vessel against the nerve. 
Plan: 
- Will start tegretol to reduce the excitability of the nerve. 
- If the medication does not provide adequate pain relief, will discuss surgical options. 
Follow-up instructions: 
- Return to clinic in 1 month for reassessment.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Trigeminal neuralgia 
Assessment: Patient presents with right-sided facial pain, likely due to trigeminal neuralgia caused by compression of the blood vessel against the nerve. No neurological deficits were found during physical examination. 
Plan: 
- Will start tegretol 200mg BID. 
- Will refer patient to genetic testing to determine safety of tegretol. 
- If pain persists, will consider surgery. 
Follow-up instructions: 
- Return to clinic in 1 month for reassessment.",B is better
